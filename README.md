# üåç Air Quality Data Dashboard using Python

This project is a **comprehensive dashboard solution** developed in Python that analyzes and visualizes air quality data using various advanced techniques. It leverages Python's data manipulation and visualization libraries to generate clear, insightful, and interactive visual reports.

## üìå Project Objectives

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values with forward fill (`ffill`)  
   - Removed duplicates  
   - Normalized column names for consistency

2. **Descriptive Statistics**  
   - Summary statistics (mean, median, quartiles) for numeric columns using `describe()`

3. **Pivot Tables & Aggregation**  
   - Generated pivot tables to observe average pollutant values by location and type

4. **Advanced Graphing and Charting**  
   - Line plot for top 10 cities by average pollutant level  
   - Pie chart for top 6 cities with the most data  
   - Bar chart for top 10 pollutants  
   - Heatmap for correlation among numerical attributes

5. **Interactive Dashboard Elements**  
   - Scenario analysis using new columns for high/low estimates  
   - Identified the city with the highest average pollution
